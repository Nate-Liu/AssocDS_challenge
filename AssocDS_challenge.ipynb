    "### Positive News Trend Analysis:\n",
    "- There's a noticeable pattern where **sales tend to increase towards the end of the year**, likely around the holiday season, which could suggest a **seasonal effect**.\n",
    "- In years and months with Positive News, we observe a **stronger end-of-year sales increase**, which might indicate that **positive media coverage** is effectively boosting sales during this period.\n",
    "- The increase in sales during the latter months, such as November and December, could be related to **promotional activities or holiday shopping behaviors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Coverage Trend Analysis:\n",
    "- In contrast, the graph with Negative Coverage shows **less end-of-year sales spikes** compared to the Positive News graph.\n",
    "- Sales appear to be more consistent throughout the year in the presence of Negative Coverage, with **fewer peaks**.\n",
    "- The dampening of the end-of-year spike could suggest that **negative publicity impacts** the usual seasonal sales boosts.\n",
    "- Interestingly, while Negative Coverage seems to reduce the magnitude of the seasonal peaks, it **doesn't negate the overall upward trend** towards the year's end, indicating **other factors** may also be influencing sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Interpretation:\n",
    "- The presence of Positive News correlates with an **accentuated increase in sales towards the end of the year**, reinforcing the idea that **positive media attention can have a beneficial impact** on consumer behavior.\n",
    "- Negative Coverage might **mitigate the positive impact of seasonality on sales**, but it doesn't entirely reverse the seasonal trend, suggesting that sales are influenced by a **complex set of factors** beyond media coverage.\n",
    "- It's essential to consider **other variables not shown in these graphs** that could be affecting sales, such as **marketing campaigns, economic conditions, or changes in product offerings**.\n",
    "- The above graph tells us that **sales tend to spike at the end of year**, this confirms that the sales vary with the ‘Date’ (time) and there is a **seasonality factor** present in our data.\n"

    "- **Positive Correlation**: There appears to be a **positive correlation** between advertising spend and sales, as indicated by the overall upward trend in the data points. This suggests that higher advertising spend is generally associated with higher sales.\n",
    "- **Data Density**: Most data points are clustered at the lower end of advertising spend, which indicates that there are more records with lower advertising budgets.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: There are some outliers, particularly in the higher end of advertising spend, where the sales do not increase proportionately. This could be due to various factors such as market saturation, ineffective advertising, or external economic conditions.\n",
    "- **Trendline**: The trendline, shown in dark blue, provides a **linear approximation of the general trend** of the data. It highlights the average effect of advertising spend on sales across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications:\n",
    "- **Marketing Efficiency**: The pattern observed suggests that there may be an **optimal range of advertising spend** where the return on investment in terms of sales is maximized.\n",
    "- **Budget Allocation**: Companies may consider increasing their advertising budget up to a point where the sales continue to grow proportionately, beyond which the additional spend may yield **diminishing returns**."

    "### Model Fit and Forecast Analysis\n",
    "The Prophet model output showcases several key features:\n",
    "- **Actual Sales Data**: Represented by the black dots, they give a clear indication of historical sales variability and seasonality.\n",
    "- **Forecasted Sales**: The blue line indicates the model's predicted sales values, showing a grasp of the data's underlying patterns and trends.\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval**: The shaded blue area illustrates the forecast's uncertainty, providing a visual representation of prediction confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations from the plot:\n",
    "- The seasonal peaks and troughs in the historical data are well-captured by the model's forecast.\n",
    "- The model projects an upward trend in sales, suggesting a positive growth expectation. This looks much better compared with SARIMAX Model which has not able to projects an upard trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Forecast\n",
    "The component plots break down the forecast into its constituent parts:\n",
    "- **Trend**: A general increase over time suggests overall sales growth.\n",
    "- **Weekly Seasonality**: Fluctuations in sales during the week could inform marketing strategies and operational planning.\n",
    "- **Yearly/Daily Seasonality**: Insight into periods of high or low activity throughout the year or day, which can aid in long-term planning and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metric\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The model achieves an RMSE of approximately 19.58, which is a standard metric for evaluating the accuracy of a model's predictions. The effectiveness of the RMSE value is contingent upon the sales data scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The Prophet model demonstrates a strong capability in capturing the sales data's patterns, with effective trend identification and seasonality projection. The RMSE indicates the model's predictions are relatively accurate, though the actual performance should be contextualized within the specific business environment."

    "- The **predicted sales appear relatively stable** throughout the month, with no dramatic increases or decreases indicated by the forecasting model.\n",
    "- A **slight uptrend** can be observed towards the middle of the month, which could be related to increased consumer activity during the holiday season.\n",

    "### Strategic Recommendations for the Company\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the expected sales pattern:\n",
    "- **Stock Inventory**: The company should ensure adequate stock levels to meet the anticipated increase in consumer demand, particularly around mid-December.\n",
    "- **Marketing and Promotions**: Aligning marketing efforts with the uptick in sales could further boost revenue; consider launching targeted campaigns just before the peak period.\n",
    "- **Staffing and Support**: Prepare for an influx of customer inquiries and sales activity by adjusting staffing levels and customer service resources accordingly during peak times.\n",
    "- **Post-Peak Strategy**: Develop a post-peak plan to maintain customer engagement and manage excess inventory as the sales trend begins to normalize towards the end of December."
